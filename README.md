# Portfolio & Meeting Manager

A modern, full-stack web application for managing client meetings and showcasing professional projects, built with React, TypeScript, Express, and integrates with Google Sheets for data storage. The application is designed to work in both local development (Express server) and production deployment (Vercel serverless functions).

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This application has a dual architecture approach:

1. **Local Development**: Uses Express.js server to serve both the API endpoints and the client-side application
2. **Production (Vercel)**: Uses Vercel's serverless functions (in `/api-routes`) for API endpoints and static hosting for the client

This approach allows for a smooth development experience locally while leveraging Vercel's serverless architecture in production.
